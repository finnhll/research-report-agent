# Research & Report Agent

A Python + LangGraph multi-agent system that turns a broad research question into a cited report.

## Status

**Fullstack MVP, LLM-backed.** The repository contains a Python/LangGraph orchestrator-worker runtime, FastAPI service, SQLite persistence, and React dashboard. The planner, worker, critic, guardrail, and synthesizer agents all call a real model — see [`docs/plans/2026-08-20-real-llm-rebuild.md`](docs/plans/2026-08-20-real-llm-rebuild.md) for why and what changed.

## What it will do

Given a research goal such as:

> Compare the top 3 EV battery chemistries for cost and safety.

the system will:

1. Apply an intake guardrail.
2. Plan 3–6 discrete research tasks.
3. Fan out worker agents with LangGraph.
4. Validate structured findings and sources.
5. Review quality with a critic agent.
6. Retry, revise, or re-plan within strict limits.
7. Synthesize a cited Markdown report.
8. Apply a final-output guardrail before delivery.
9. Stream live progress to the browser.
10. Display and download the cited Markdown report.

## Tech stack

- Python 3.11+
- LangGraph
- Pydantic
- FastAPI
- SQLAlchemy
- React
- TypeScript
- Vite
- asyncio
- pytest
- Ruff

## Development setup

```bash
python3.11 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"
cd frontend
npm install
```

## Run locally

Start both services:

```bash
./scripts/dev.sh
```

- Frontend: http://127.0.0.1:5173
- Backend API: http://127.0.0.1:8000
- API docs: http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs

You can also run the services separately:

```bash
.venv/bin/python -m uvicorn research_report_agent.main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
```

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

The agents need a model API key before a run can start. Click **⚙ Model API** in the
running dashboard: pick a **Provider** (OpenAI, DeepSeek, or Anthropic — the model and
Base URL auto-fill with sensible defaults for each), paste a key, and save. Settings
persist server-side to a gitignored `model-config.json`. `web_search` itself needs no
key — it uses DuckDuckGo's keyless HTML endpoint.

Equivalent env vars work too (see [`.env.example`](.env.example)): `AGENT_PROVIDER` /
`AGENT_MODEL` plus `OPENAI_API_KEY` / `OPENAI_BASE_URL` for OpenAI or DeepSeek, or
`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` / `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` for Anthropic — `model-config.json` values
always win over env vars.

- **OpenAI** and **DeepSeek** (`deepseek-v4-flash` / `deepseek-v4-pro` at
  `https://api.deepseek.com` — confirmed OpenAI-compatible, including
  `response_format: json_object` and the `/models` list endpoint, against
  [DeepSeek's API docs](https://api-docs.deepseek.com)) both go through the OpenAI
  Python SDK. Any other OpenAI-compatible gateway works too — pick "OpenAI" and set a
  custom Base URL.
- **Anthropic** (`claude-opus-5` / `claude-sonnet-5` / `claude-haiku-4-5`) uses the
  Anthropic Python SDK's native `messages.parse(output_format=...)` structured output
  instead — Claude's Messages API isn't OpenAI-compatible, so it gets its own backend
  in `llm.py` rather than being shoehorned through the JSON-mode path.

`model-config.json` in this checkout is currently set to DeepSeek's `deepseek-v4-flash`
— add your key via the Settings panel or `export OPENAI_API_KEY=<your DeepSeek key>`
(get one at https://platform.deepseek.com/api_keys).
